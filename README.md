## 📈 Analyses Conducted  
### 1. Cohort Retention Analysis  
- Customers were grouped by their **month of acquisition**.  
- Tracked the **retention rate** across subsequent months.  
- Results showed a sharp drop in retention after the first month, but also revealed a loyal base of repeat customers who return in later periods.  
- These insights highlight the nature of the products sold (durable tech items and promotional goods) and reinforce the importance of **cross-sell** and **engagement strategies**.  

### 2. RFM Analysis  
- **Recency**: identified customers who purchased most recently.  
- **Frequency**: measured the number of purchases per customer.  
- **Monetary Value**: calculated the total spend per customer.  
- Based on these metrics, customers were segmented into groups such as:  
  - **Loyal Customers**  
  - **High-Value Customers**  
  - **At-Risk Customers**  
  - **Occasional Buyers**  

This segmentation enables prioritization of marketing actions according to the profile and strategic value of each group.
